        <h1>Blog moving to GitHub</h1><time>October 29, 2020</time></header><p>It&rsquo;s the time of year when Wordpress.com is reminding me to renew my subscription
and since I really don&rsquo;t blog as much as I used to back in the days, the price
is just a bit to high.</p>
<h2 id="hosting-or-not">Hosting or not?</h2>
<p>I started to look for a replacement service, initially I was thinking of hosting
my it on a virtual server somewhere as that&rsquo;s half the price of Wordpress. True
that it would make me manage the server but with ansible that would still be
trivial. First I was looking at <a href="https://www.linode.com" title="Linode" target="_blank">Linode</a> as the
cheapest server was only a cup of coffee and this was reasonable for a monthly
price, and on it run Wordpress like I used to when I was really active.</p>
<p>As it sometimes happens, curiosity kicked in and I stared digging into static
site generators. And the simplicity they bring was pulling me in. I already
use MarkDown for a lot and looking at <a href="https://gohugo.io" title="Hugo" target="_blank">Hugo</a> made
me even more curious if I could run everything from it.</p>
<p>Done and dusted, easy local installation with <a href="https://brew.sh" title="Homebrew" target="_blank">Brew</a>
was screaming go,go, gooooo.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ brew install hugo
</code></pre></div><p>Now the hosting, should it run on my rented hardware or not. After some
consideration I decided to try Github pages, for now this will be the solution
although I might change that in the future if I want to have a server running
somewhere again.</p>
<h2 id="can-it-be-this-simple">Can it be this simple?</h2>
<p>After installing and initializing my site locally I copied my blogposts from
wordpress to .md files. The simplicity is just amazing. The biggest headache I
had was to find a simple engough theme to use. After some trials I ended up with
<a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/etch/" title="Hugo Etch Theme" target="_blank">Etch</a>. It was simple enough
and I was able to get the few changes done I wanted.</p>
<p>The use of git and Github is also extremely nice, it just fits in my workflow.
Fits like a glove some would say, while we Finns say &ldquo;Fits like a fist in the eye&rdquo;.
I can keep everything with me all the time, and when I change to a new device
everything is seconds away.</p>
