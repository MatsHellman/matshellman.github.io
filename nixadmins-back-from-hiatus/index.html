        <h1>Nixadmins.net back from hiatus</h1><time>November 21, 2019</time></header><p>I can’t believe it’s now 7 years since I was actively posting content. Why? I
started as a Field Engineer at Microsoft and could not find the time nor energy
to keep creating quality content. It’s now a year since I changed my role
starting as an Architect designing the device journey with all that comes with
it. With this role in mind my posts in the future will be different, the content
will be wider than before, meaning I will create posts about the design journeys
and the architectural view as well. But, as I am still me, and deep inside a
geek who loves to tinker with things from A-Z the content will also reflect this.</p>
<p>In my daily life I’m now more or less in multiple platforms, using Windows,
MacOS and Linux in my daily life. Some posts will be deep in a technology sense
while others might offer you high level views on services I am working on in my
daily life.</p>
<p>I will not commit to a schedule as this site still mostly notes on my personal
ramblings and trying to answer questions I get in my daily life.</p>
<p>First up will be recreation of some of the former posts as I have lost my
backups from my previous site in 2013. Some of them were extremely popular
and I still haven’t found a good  replacement for them.</p>
