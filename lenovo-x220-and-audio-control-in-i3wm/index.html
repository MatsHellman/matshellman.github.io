        <h1>Lenovo X220 audio control in i3wm</h1><time>April 21, 2020</time></header><p>This will serve as a note to myself as I found myself really looking for it
every time I redid the device.</p>
<p>The Lenovo X220 has audio control buttons above the keyboard and they are nice
to have working when using the device.
I use i3-wm myself and I have a old version of my i3 config in my Github,
yes it’s time to update it as well so I don’t have to do this every time.</p>
<p>Anyway, this time the writing is for Debian, I’m using the testing version but
I would assume this works in any of them. First and foremost, I am using the
kernel module thinkpad_acpi and alsa, if you are using pulseaudio you need to
look for the commands for that.</p>
<p>In my i3-config I have the following</p>
<h3 id="audio-setting">Audio setting</h3>
<p>bindsym XF86AudioRaiseVolume exec “amixer -q sset Master,0 1+ unmute”<br>
bindsym XF86AudioLowerVolume exec “amixer -q sset Master,0 1- unmute”<br>
bindsym XF86AudioMute exec “amixer -q sset Master,0 toggle”</p>
<p>Reload your i3 config and you should see the mute led turn on and of as you press it.
Volume up and down works as well.</p>
