      <title>Blog moving to GitHub</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s the time of year when Wordpress.com is reminding me to renew my subscription and since I really don&amp;rsquo;t blog as much as I used to back in the days, the price is just a bit to high.
Hosting or not? I started to look for a replacement service, initially I was thinking of hosting my it on a virtual server somewhere as that&amp;rsquo;s half the price of Wordpress. True that it would make me manage the server but with ansible that would still be trivial.</description>

      <description>This will serve as a note to myself as I found myself really looking for it every time I redid the device.
The Lenovo X220 has audio control buttons above the keyboard and they are nice to have working when using the device. I use i3-wm myself and I have a old version of my i3 config in my Github, yes itâ€™s time to update it as well so I donâ€™t have to do this every time.</description>

      <description>As a geek I do like a lot of the modern things. At work I spend my time working with device services ranging from cloud services like Intune to things like traditional printing in factory floors.
There is very little that getâ€™s me as exited as opening a box with new hardware in it, but from time to time I feel the hardware improvements are eaten alive by the ever growing complexity of the software.</description>

      <title>Scrolling with an external mouse in MacOS</title>

      <description>If you have used a Mac with an external mouse you know there is something funky about this. In MacOS you can not individually select the scroll direction for a external mouse vs the trackpad. The trackpad when you want to scroll down a page you basically drag trough it and itâ€™s a very natural motion, this however means that the scroll wheel on your external mouse will go the opposite way, whoever came up with this should work on a chair with nails for a few years.</description>

      <title>MacOS black screen after sleep</title>

      <description>Yesterday I decided it was time to upgrade my MacBook Pro 2018 from Mojave to Catalina. Easy update but in the future if someone tells you Windows 10 upgrades are slow, ask them to try it on a Mac. I can update all Windows devices in my house one by one faster than my Mac from 10.14 to 10.15.
Anyhow, this was not a post to beat down my Mac, I do still like parts of you ðŸ˜€</description>

      <title>MacOS : Unhide dock faster</title>

      <description>As Iâ€™ve stated I more or less cross paths almost on a daily basis with all the major operating systems. Most of the time my main driver is the 2018 MacBook Pro which is with me whenever I leave the comfort of the home-office.
Although the resolution is good on this device the dock at the bottom takes up a bit of space. I must say Iâ€™m not a heavy dock user, Iâ€™ve learnt long ago to use CMD+Space to find my applications, just like I use the Windows key in Windows 10 and MOD+D in my i3wm on Arch Linux.</description>

      <title>Hey, where&#39;s my Yubikey?</title>

      <description>This post is just for myself to remember this as it was behind so many clicks on the oh so phenomenal ArchWiki.
For many years I have been using multifactor authentication where possible. SMS in the beginning and today mostly authenticator application(s) or the Yubikey(s). These together with a decent password manager make me feel at least a bit more secure with all the accounts and passwords I need to remember.</description>

      <description>I canâ€™t believe itâ€™s now 7 years since I was actively posting content. Why? I started as a Field Engineer at Microsoft and could not find the time nor energy to keep creating quality content. Itâ€™s now a year since I changed my role starting as an Architect designing the device journey with all that comes with it. With this role in mind my posts in the future will be different, the content will be wider than before, meaning I will create posts about the design journeys and the architectural view as well.</description>
