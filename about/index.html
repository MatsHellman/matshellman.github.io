<p>A geek, I really enjoy new technology, mostly because there is always something
new to learn. I used to work as a Premier Field Engineer at Microsoft
specializing in Windows and Configuration Manager. The time spent there was
a lot of fun. Now I work as a Modern Workspace Architect designing the
workspace services. Less tech, more painting the future.</p>
<p>As everyone who&rsquo;s in tech knows, it&rsquo;s really hard to just leave the tinkering
behind, so now I do that at home in my own personal projects and write about it
here.</p>
<h2 id="tech-ramblings-of-a-geek">Tech ramblings of a geek</h2>
<p>This page serves as my notes for things I find interesting. I used to be a very
active blogger but these days time does not permit a lot of blogging so this
page serves as a place I can organize notes and share the information if it
ever would help someone else.</p>
<p>Word of warning though, sometimes it might contain my own opinions, and opinions
are like as*es, everyone has one, so don&rsquo;t get offended. Like, <strong>vi</strong> is &gt; than
<strong>Emacs</strong> :D</p>
<h2 id="page-served-from-github">Page served from GitHub</h2>
<p>The page is served with <a href="https://gohugo.io" title="Hugo" target="_blank">Hugo</a> the static page
generator and it&rsquo;s hosted on GitHub pages. In 2020 the blog was moved from a
Wordpress.com instance to here. As the content is quite static, and I don&rsquo;t
do any advertising on the page the free GitHub service is perfect.</p>
