        <h1>Hey, where&#39;s my Yubikey?</h1><time>November 22, 2019</time></header><p>This post is just for myself to remember this as it was behind so many clicks
on the oh so phenomenal <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org" title="ArchLinux Wiki" target="_blank">ArchWiki</a>.</p>
<p>For many years I have been using multifactor authentication where possible.
SMS in the beginning and today mostly authenticator application(s) or the
Yubikey(s). These together with a decent password manager make me feel at least
a bit more secure with all the accounts and passwords I need to remember.
If you are looking for a password manager to help make your life a bit laid back
when it comes to password management I recommend you take a look at

<h2 id="problems-">Problems &hellip;</h2>
<p>Some nights ago I decided to install Arch Linux on one of my workstations. Easy
and fast installation with a very customizable system, whatâ€™s there not to like ðŸ˜€</p>
<p>Since the system is so highly customizable, you need to read. And I do really
love learning something new, I just have an issue remembering a week down the
line what I did. So thatâ€™s why this post is here. This way I can find it fast
the next time I need it.</p>
<p>So, the problem was that my Yubikey did not show up in Firefox. First thing
first you always check dmesg to make sure the device is even recognized.
And so I did,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">usb 1-2: new full-speed USB device number <span style="color:#2aa198">5</span> using xhci_hcd

</code></pre></div><p>And there it was. At least my system knew about it. Some
<a href="https://duckduckgo.com" title="DuckDuckGo" target="_blank">duckduckgo.com:fu</a>
later I found an article on
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Firefox/Tweaks#Fido_U2F_authentication" title="ArchWiki Link" target="_blank">ArchWiki Fido U2F authentication</a>
pointing me to the
libu2f-host package. Easy as 1,2,3 fire up pacman install the package and
restart the browser and my Yubikey is back in business.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ sudo pacman -S libu2f-host  
resolving dependencies...  
looking <span style="color:#719e07">for</span> conflicting packages...  
</code></pre></div><p>This as stated above is not meant to be a guide on MFA or the Yubikey, just a
placeholder for me to remember what I did if I ever run into it again.</p>
